    direction LR

    superheroes {
        int id 
        varchar nickname
        varchar real_name
        varchar origin_description
        varchar superpowers
        varchar catch_phrase
        }

    images {
        int id 
        int superhero_id 
        varchar url
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }
   ```

**Database relation:**  
`superheroes.id (PK)` â†’ `images.superhero_id (FK)`

## Assumptions
## Assumptions

- Images are stored in the public `uploads` folder and are deleted when a superhero is deleted or when some of its images are removed.
- Requests to modify or check an existing superhero are done by `nickname`, assuming that each superhero is unique.
- `nickname` is unique for each superhero.
- If a superhero has no images, the first letter of their nickname is displayed.
- Demo superheroes are created automatically during migration.
- Axios is used for API requests.
- Frontend uses Tailwind CSS;
